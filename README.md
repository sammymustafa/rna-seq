# RNA-Sequencing Projects

Attached are short PDF summaries of findings from several projects investigating various datasets throughout the RNA-seq process! Here are descriptions of what each project investigates/finds:

* Project 1: Making FastQc/MultiQC report for six biological yeast replicates of wild type & SNF2 mutants (summarizes 84 files)
* Project 2: Identifying faster methods of downloading sequencing data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
* Project 3: Aligning biological yeast replicates using STAR
* Project 4: Aligning two biological samples (GEO accession) of human data, sequencing of whole blood at 2 hour intervals
* Project 5: Make count tables, correlation plot, and gene variance scatterplot of yeast wildtype and the mutant biological replicates via R 
* Project 6: Differential expression analyses and visualization using DESeq2 via R
* Project 7: Aligning single cell sequencing data and analyzing the counts with Seurat via R
* Project 8: RNA sequencing from 21 septic shock and 11 cardiogenic shock patients samples taken at three timepoints in respect to ICU admission, studied number of genes that significantly changed betwee timepoints and compared the time course of gene expression across the conditions
